So I've really struggled these past few weeks. I began learning Object Oriented Ruby, and while I understood the basics, it just wasnt clicking for me. All the labs seemed to take much longer than usual, and I was getting extremely frustrated with myself because I started to think I was never going to understand it. It's been rough to say the least, however, I'm genuinely happy that I got to that point and here's why. 

As a self-paced student, I rely on Ask a Question, Ruby-doc, Google, etc. however, I've always been too much of an introvert to reach out on Slack and get help from the Flatiron Community. When I first realized it wasn't clicking, and I needed more help than AAQ, I reached out to other self-paced students on the channel. I explained that I was having difficulty with OO Ruby and I just couldn't understand it. Every single response was super helpful, and extremely supportive and it made it easier for me to continue. One person sent me links of videos and websites she used when she too was struggling with it, she also mentioned the study groups that helped her. Another person recommended a book that I'm still going through, but has definitely helped me get through the labs; and one other person told me to try and look ahead to harder OO Ruby labs, he explained that sometimes the more simple labs make it harder to understand the logic behind OO Ruby, and the more advanced labs would make more sense. Honestly, he was right! 

Anyway, I digress, I say all that to say this: although I'm a self-paced student, I'm never alone in learning to code. This community is extremely supportive, and if you ask for help you'll receive it. While I won't be able to attend every study group (since they mostly happen when I'm at work), I know I can reach out and I'll be able to get the guidance I may need. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to catch up on some labs from these last few weeks I've been spinning in circles!
