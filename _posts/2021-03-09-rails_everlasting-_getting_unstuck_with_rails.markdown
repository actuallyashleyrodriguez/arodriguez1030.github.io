**Warning: This is going to be a long blog post regarding my project, Finding Furever. **

If you've ever adopted an animal, you know it's hard to look up different shelters in your area and see exactly which animals are available for adoption. I remember when I got my dog 10 years ago I traveled to around 7 different shelters in NYC, Brooklyn, and Queens, in the middle of a cold, cold winter.  At one point I was frustrated because I asked every shelter if I could see  the dogs available for adoption online, but that didn't seem to be an option. I had thought to myself, it would be easier to see the dogs available before I go there so that I don't schlep it out to for no reason. Lo and Behold, 10 years later when I'm creating my Rails project, Finding Furever was created. 

Finding Furever is a site where you get a list of shelters, and you can see all the available animals that are up for adoption at those shelters. If you find a pet that you are interested in, or think you might connect with, you can submit a preliminary application to the Shelter so you can meet your potential pet in person. 

I'm going to be completely honest with you, this project took me a long time to complete; the rails section in general took me quite a few months. I had an original desired completion date for my project of December 15, 2020. Between confusion in rails, a full-time job, and catching COVID, I finished almost 3 months after that date. However, ***I am grateful that I paced myself and took my time***, because I can confidently say that my understanding of Rails, is much clearer now than it was in December. 

When I first began Finding Furever, I felt comfortable with associations, creating migrations, creating forms, controller and routes. What confused me was nested routes, forms, scopes, and helpers (basically all the rails magic).

^Visual interpretation of me re-reading the lessons and the information on the above items.^

In the midst of my disappointment with my lack of understanding, I decided to go back to basics and re-read all of the rails lessons again. Personally, I learn best either from doing something directly, or by physically writing the information down in my own words. So, I pulled up my Rocketbook (stay green, folks) and went back to the first lesson so I could grasp everything. I did this for weeks until I felt I truly understood the information. At 5 in the morning before work, during my lunch hours at 12, and even when I got home at night, I would go through each lesson (or video) and summarize everything in a way that worked best for me. If any of the verbiage was confusing, I would refer to the documentation or Google to make sure what I was writing was correct.  It was time consuming, and I knew I was going much slower than I wanted to, but I was finally beginning the grasp the things that were so confusing to me. 


Even though I understood the concepts, I still made mistakes. I couldn't tell you how many errors I got while trying to include Scope methods and Helper Methods in my code. But debugging those mistakes helped me learn the syntax, and the way to write them. It was probabaly the most beneficial part of the entire coding process.  **Don't be afraid to mess up!** Messing up will help you, and if you make a mistake, so what? You can always correct it! 

Most importantly, if you feel stuck or feel burned out, ASK FOR HELP. You can go through all the research and videos, but if you're at a place of burn out, it won't stick! I definitely suggest attending a study group, or asking someone else to be a sounding board for you. There are definitely ways for you to learn Rails, or how to code in general without getting frustrated or burned out.  Just remember:
