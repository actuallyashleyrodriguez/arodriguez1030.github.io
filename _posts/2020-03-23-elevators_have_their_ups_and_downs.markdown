Hi All! Thanks for taking the time to read my blog, and my corny joke (sorry about that). Here's a little bit about myself: my name is  Ashley, I'm from New York and I  am an account executive for an elevator company. That last part usually gets people's attention, and they tend to ask, "Wow! How did you get into that?". The short answer is I needed a job after college, and after applying everywhere my previous  company gave me the best package. 

I'm not going to lie, it was scary starting a sales job with no knowledge whatsoever about elevators.  I spent the next 3 months at my company working on the field with mechanics to get a crash course on elevators and to actually  have some intellect about what I was selling. Even though I was learning a lot, elevators never interested me and I never was excited to talk about elevators. I'm at the point in my life where I want excitement at work (especially because I'm  there more than I'm home) I want something that is interesting to me, and challenges me! So, a couple of months ago I began looking into different careers to see what I would enjoy.

I looked into many different fields, different titles within those fields, and tried to envision myself doing these jobs. I was asking myself "Would I be happy doing this?". Then, I began researching programming  (side note: I used to be TERRIFIED of coding because I thought it was a super intimidating field) and when I began researching it, I was surprised at how I was so  intrigued by wanting  to learn how to code. I immediately began teaching myself on different coding apps,  and I was intimidated but couldnt stop. So I began a bootcamp prep course and I was HOOKED. Even at the most frustrating times, I was trying to figure out HOW to make the code work. Not once these last few years have I ever felt like that  learning elevators. That solidified my decision and I'm so happy I've found something I enjoy; I can't wait to see what the future brings!
