My very first project is here! I have to say I was extremely excited to get to this point, but at the same time there was a lot of doubt. There was the feeling of "Can I do this alone?" "Without Flatiron's tests will I be able to know what to do?" and "What if I completely fail? What would I do?". Obviously that's not the right mindset to have when you're getting into anything, but the imposter syndrome was hitting me hard! Luckily, I knew exactly what I wanted to do and how I wanted it to come out. 

Jokes on me. Of course my carefully thought out vision came to a screetching hault when every single website that had the information I was looking for was not scrapable! That was the absolutely last thing I needed, honestly. On my 7th website that failed me, I was so frustrated. I spent more hours finding the right website to scrape, than I actually did scraping the website (funny enough that part came *easier* to me). Two days, and I lost track of how many websites later, I finally found ***the one***. You know those scenes in movies, when the clouds part and there's the moment when everything turns around. Well, that was that moment for me. I was so excited, I could FINALLY finish my flow-chart and planning, but most important I could FINALLY start my code. Can I get a woot woot? (**woot woot!**)

I was super excited to start my project, but I wasn't sure ***where*** to start. Luckily, Flatiron has tutorials for days on the CLI (Eden Events is a great one to reference if you're in need of assistance). Personally, the rest of the project was fairly simple and easy, since I already had an idea of how I wanted the flow to go (shout out to the flow-chart that was part of the planning requirements!). I would say after the bundle was created, a majority of my time was getting the code to output the items exactly the way I wanted, which just meant googling different methods to get me where I wanted to go. 

Although I was terrified going into this, and was doubting my abilities, I realized I know a lot more than I thought I did. The doubt I had in the beginning of the project, made the completion of it so much sweeter! I'm very proud of myself for making something from scratch, and it makes me even more excited to get to the next projects!
